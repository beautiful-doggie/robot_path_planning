# 智能机器人路径规划

This project simulates the process of mobile robot path planning and tracking in a 2D environment.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main entry point for the simulation.
- `planners/`: Contains different path planning algorithms.
- `controllers/`: Contains different path tracking controllers.
- `utils/`: Utility functions for environment setup and visualization.
- `data/`: Stores results and logs.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/beautiful-doggie/robot_path_planning.git
    cd robot_path_planning
    ```



## Usage

Run the main simulation script:
```sh
python main.py
